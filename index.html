            <h1>The History of Craft Beer in Ontario</h1>
            <div class="full-width-col">
                <p>From its inception, the foundation of the Ontario economy was built on the supply and demand of a few basic commodities: fur, lumber and beer.</p>
                <p>Our early beer industry started with small brewers-craftsmen who applied their Old World skills to brewing unique, personal beers. It was a regional business, producing regional beers to satisfy regional tastes.</p>
                <p>With the arrival of the 20th century, Prohibition, the Depression and two world wars many small brewers were forced to close down or consolidate. The number of breweries was reduced to an all-time low. Advanced technology gave rise to large breweries and mass production.</p>

            <h1>The Brewing Renaissance in Canada</h1>
            <div class="full-width-col">
                <p>In the 1980's, after decades of flat sales, a resurgence of Canadian independent brewing began. The passion and commitment of these entrepreneurs helped expand the market. This 'flavour revolution' created a renewed interest in beer among a new generation of consumers.</p>

                <p>In 1984, Jim Brickman was the first craft brewery to start up in Ontario, and is credited with pioneering the present day craft brewing renaissance in Canada. Soon after, several other independent breweries joined the movement with a focus on hand-crafted beers. These audacious brewers were determined to prove that Canadian beer drinkers were ready for something that had been missing for over 60 years: better taste and variety.</p>

                <p>The so-called "Renaissance of craft-brewing" has spawned a concentration of small breweries rivaling some of the great brewing areas of Europe!"</p>

                <p><strong>"Ontario craft brewers are involved in a long term strategic plan that will change the face of the Ontario beer industry forever. We have 30 diverse breweries, that have joined together to embrace this plan and build on their passion for brewing great tasting beer."</strong><br>
