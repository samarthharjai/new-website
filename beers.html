            <p>Often times a lack of potable water created a need for something drinkable. Thus, refreshing farmhouse ales were traditionally brewed on farmsteads during the cooler off-season and stored for “Les Saisonaires” (seasonal farm workers), who toiled during the summer months. The purpose for these “rustic house brews” varied from that of pure sustenance to reward for hard work and/or a successful harvest.</p>

            <p>Our Farmhouse Ale Collection pays homage to this tradition, while integrating both our natural surroundings and local agriculture. These beers are brewed in a style that allows them to further develop and benefit from aging in the bottle. Saison, Biere de Garde and Biere de Mars are available all year long, while the Biere de Noel only releases during the holiday season (November – January). Additionally, we get out of the box at least once a year with limited-edition, one-off Farmhouse Ale of our Brewmaster’s choice.</p>

            <h2>Saison</h2>

            <h3>Our bottle-conditioned Saison is brewed and crafted in the classic Wallonian-style.</h3>

            <p>Golden yellow in colour with a pillowy white head from the effervescence one may only find as a result of secondary fermentation.</p>

            <p>Initial flavours of banana, black pepper and citrus fade into a yeast driven earthy character and bone-dry finish. The concentrated effervescence, not only creates body, but also adds a silky, smooth mouthfeel. This quality has earned bottle-conditioned Saisons the reputation for being one of the most versatile beers in the world to pair with food.</p>

            <p>Ages well for up to two years, with peak drinkability at 1 year.</p>

            <h2>Biere De Garde</h2>

            <h3>Biere de Garde literally translates to “beer for keeping” and is a style traditionally brewed in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region of France.</h3>

            <p>Keeping with this style, our bottle-conditioned Biere de Garde is a more robust, malt driven Farmhouse Ale with characteristics of caramel, cocoa, burnt sugar and dark cherries. As it ages, the darker brownish hue fades into that of reddish-orange, with the minute oxidation creating a wonderfully complex profile. This beer is a real treat around the two year mark!</p>

            <p>Ages well for up to three years, with peak drinkability around the 2 year mark.</p>

            <p>Ages well for up to two years, with peak drinkability at 1 year.</p>
